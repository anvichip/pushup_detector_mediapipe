# Push-Up Counter using MediaPipe and OpenCV

This project utilizes the MediaPipe Pose model and OpenCV to create a push-up counter. It tracks the user's pose in real-time and counts push-ups based on the detected angles during the exercise.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- MediaPipe (`pip install mediapipe`)

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/push-up-counter.git
   cd push-up-counter
